Singleton class
----------------
Singleton class is a class which can have only one object at a time, and after that if we try to create another object then in that case the new reference variable also points to the previously created object. 

Rules to define a singleton class : 

1. Make constructor private, so that we cannot create object of that specific class from outside(i.e from another class)

2. Make static method which returns object of singleton class , and whose return type is of that specific singleton class type.

Here Operation is performed by : 
    a. Eager Initialization
       Whether we needs object or not, Eager initialization will creates object when class loads.

    b. Lazy Initialization
       Lazy Initialization will not creates object when class loads, it will creates object when user needs or request to create.
