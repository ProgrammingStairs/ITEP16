Abstraction : Abstracttion is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
Here we can achieve abstraction with the help of : 
    a. Abstract class
    b. Interface 

a. Abstract class : 
-------------------
1. For making any class as an abstract, we need to put abstract keyword followed by class name.
2. In java, its not mandatory to have abstract method to make any class as an abstract class. 
3. Abstract class cannot be instantiated, which means we cannot create object of abstract class.
4. Abstract class can contains : 
    i. abstract method(method whose definition part is absent)
    ii. concrete method(method whose definition part is present)
    iii. constructor 
5. Abstract class provides reference to the child class, where child class may create there own object with respect to that specific abstract class.
6. If any child class extends abstract parent class(containing abstract method), then in that case its mandatory for the child class to give the implementation of that specific abstract method otherwise it will gives you compilation error. 
7. If we want to achieve some functionality forcefully from child class then in that case we can create abstract method.
8. With the help of abstract class we can achieve 0 to 100% abstraction
9. syntax :  abstract class Demo{ // abstract class
                abstract void display(); // abstract method
             }
